  To talk to a Box from Windows you need to do the following setup for
communication:

1. Go to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
   and download PuTTY to your computers Desktop. 

2. Start PuTTY.  If you get a pop-up warning about starting a downloaded
   program, you need to unblock it.  Exit PuTTY; then right-click on it, choose
   Properties, and select 'Unblock' near the bottom of the panel.  Click
   'Apply'.

3. Start PuTTY.  On the 'Session' tab, set hostname as [BOXNAME] enter
   'batpi3' or 'batpi4' into the name box in the save panel, and then
   click 'Save'.

   Now click on the 'Data' item (on the right under 'Connection' and above
   'SSH') and set 'Auto login user' to be 'bbu'.  Go back to 'Session' and
   click Save.

   You can do this step for each of the two Boxes, if you plan to
   connect to each of them at some point.

4. Choose the session named for the Box you are connecting to, from the list
   under the Session tab, and click 'open', accept the offered public key (this
   is only needed on the first connection), type in the password 'funfunfun'.
   If all is well, you should connect to the Box, getting a black window
   containing (after a moment) some text looking something like this:

   [PROMPT]   

   If you do, it works: click close.  If not, email John.

Cheers,

	John
