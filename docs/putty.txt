  To talk to a Box from Windows you need to do the following setup for
communication:

1. Go to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
   and download PuTTY, Plink and PuTTYgen and install them on your
   machine.  You may need to be administrator to do this.

2. Start PuTTYgen.  If you get a pop-up warning about starting a
   downloaded program, you need to unblock the three you just
   downloaded.  Exit PuTTYgen; then right-click on it, choose
   Properties, and select 'Unblock' near the bottom of the panel.
   Click 'Apply'.  Do this for each of the three downloaded programs.

3. Start PuTTY.  On the 'Session' tab, set hostname as [BOXNAME] enter
   'batpi3' or 'batpi4' into the name box in the save panel, and then
   click 'Save'.

   Now click the SSH item to the left, click 'Auth', and set the
   login password to 'funfunfun'.   Click on the 'Data' item (on the
   right under 'Connection' and above 'SSH') and set 'Auto login user'
   to be 'bbu'.  Go back to 'Session' and Save again.

   You can do this step for each of the two Boxes, if you plan to
   connect to each of them at some point.

4. Choose the session named for the Box you are connecting to, from
   the list under the Session tab, and click 'open'.  If all is well,
   you should connect to the Box, getting a black window containing
   (after a moment) some text looking something like this:

   [PROMPT]   

   If you do, it works: click close.  If not, email John.

Cheers,

	John
