As there was limited time when setting up the experiment, I used the
following workaround to make the system work quickly.

First, I exposed array-cmd's udp port (2468) to external addresses.  In
addition, I added two more ports with socat(1), one to start recording
(port 2469) and one to make sure we stopped recording (2470).

The start-recording commands were as follows, on the Pi run:

    socat udp-listen:2469,fork,reuseaddr exec:/home/pi/bin/ela-exp.zsh

Where ela-exp.zsh contains:

    #!/bin/zsh

    read expname duration

    sudo grab | 
    sox -c8 -r312500 -t s16 - -t wavpcm /home/pi/ela-data/$expname.wav trim 0 $duration

This above script should terminate recording after $duration seconds,
but I added a second port with socat(1) that ran `sudo pkill grab`,
i.e.:

    socat udp-listen:2470,fork,reuseaddr exec:'sudo pkill grab'

See example1.m and the other m-scripts to see how this was used from
Matlab.
