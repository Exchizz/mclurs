Known Bugs

The sequence init - go - halt - param - init -
go can succeed but after delivering 32MiB of
data the call to check how much data is in the
Comedi streaming buffer hangs...

Reloading the modules while the snapshot
program has the Comedi device closed doesn't
fix the bug above.

The bug manifests as a Comedi buffer overrun.

WRITER only allocates one file for a snapshot,
should do at least two.  Need to sort out how the
allocation of locked transfer RAM is to be
managed...

Crashed snapshot with the request

	 ./trig --pre 5000 --post 25000 test26

after 5-6 days continuous running...  No error
reported by the program.
