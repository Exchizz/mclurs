MCLURS ADC Software
===================

  The source code here handles the collection of data from the
USBDUXfast hardware via COMEDI.  It comprises four programs:

snapshot -- the data collection daemon for snapshot capture

grab -- a data collection program for streaming data

snapchat -- a utility program for talking to snapshot

trig -- a utility program for manual pre-triggered snapshots

  The software assumes that the relevant kernel modules are available
(from the staging section, so you may need to build a kernel with that
section enabled) and for full-speed capture we recommend using the
USBDUXfast kernel driver module included in the package extras[1].

  The driver module is coded for a 3.18 version Linux kernel.  To use
it, replace the upstream source code for usbduxfast.c[2] with the
supplied module code.
