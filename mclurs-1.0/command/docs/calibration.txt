Calibration of the Array Capture Module
=======================================

The array can be spatially calibrated automatically as follows.

1. Modules are put into calibration mode.

2. As modules signal their readiness, a loud impulsive sound is made.

3. Step 2 is repeated until calibration is complete.  The sounds
   should be spread over the working volume of the array and cover the
   three-dimensional space.

4. Each module in the array computes its own spatial calibration; it
   needs at least 5 active microphones to do this.

5. Array modules compare local calibrations to compute a global
   calibration of the position of every microphone.

Theory:

  - a module has M microphones whose positions are unknown.
  - an impulsive sound is made at each of S different unknown positions.

  The module microphones have 3M-6 unknown parameters, as follows: the
  first microphone is at the origin; the second microphone is at
  position (x2,0,0); the third is at (x3,y3,0); and each subsequent
  microphone is at (xi,yi,zi).  This defines the module's local
  reference frame and the microphone positions within it.

  Each sound has 3 unknown parameters, corresponding to its position
  in the module reference frame.

  Each sound generates M-1 items of information, being the arrival
  times of the sound impulse at each microphone referred to the one
  that first detects the sound.

  Calibration is possible provided S(M-1) > 3M-6 +3S, i.e. as long as

  S(M-4) > 3M-6

  which is true for sufficiently large S provided that M > 4.

  (If the impulsive sound source can be synchronised to the module so
that the time of emission is known, each sound delivers M items of
information and one needs M > 3, rather than M > 4, to autocalibrate in
this way.)

  From this we conclude that S > 3(M - 2)/(M - 4), i.e. 5 impulses are
necessary for a module with 8 microphones, while 9 suffice for a
module with the minimum of microphones (5).  More impulses allow one to
perform an optimal fit instead of an exact solution to the equation
set.

  Once each module has computed its own calibration based on the
sequence of impulses, each module knows a set of S labelled points in
its own local frame of reference.  Two modules can compute a common
frame of reference by aligning the two sets of S points -- i.e. the
two modules can construct S pairings of coordinates between their two
frames.  Provided S > 6 this is sufficient to determine the coordinate
alignment, since the two frames are rigid and span the same 3D space.

  It should be possible to set up the joint optimisation problem where
K modules establish S K-fold correspondences, and estimate the 6K-6
parameters needed to establish the common global reference frame.
