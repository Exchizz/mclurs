MCLURS command software
=======================

  The array-cmd script handles interfacing the hardware and
snapshotter with incoming instructions to the array.  It handles the
hardware initialisation, calibration, probing of hardware UUIDs, and
the set-up of snapshot metadata.

  The script is normally run as a daemon, listening on a UDP socket
for command messages.
