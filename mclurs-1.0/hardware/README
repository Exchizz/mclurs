MCLURS Hardware.
================

The hardware is as far as possible commodity computing equipment.
Nevertheless there is some custom electronics, in the form of an
analogue signal processing board and microphone pre-amplifiers.

Version 1: (2013)

  The first version analogue board comprises 8 channels of
programmable (0-60 dB) amplification controlled by an LTC2637 D/A
chip, a 24AA64 EEPROM, an MCP79410 real-time clock, and a DS2482-800
1-wire driver.  The analogue signal path includes a bandpass filter
with corner frequencies 9.18 kHz and 151 kHz.

  Microphones are equipped with a 6 pin plug that provides 10 dB of
preamplifier gain and a 20 kBit 1-wire bus memory with unique
identifier.

Version 2A: (2014)

  Minor changes to the interface to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header allow
the connection of a serial port console cable for debugging purposes.

Version 2B: (2015)

  This extends the version 2A hardware with the addition of a PCA9534
programmable switch for turning the high-pass filter circuitry on and
off, allowing the system to be used for recording audio as well as
ultrasonic sounds.

====================

  Hardware operation requires a number of kernel modules to be
available.  Most are in the standard distributed kernel.  However, the
module for the PCA9534 (gpio-pca953x) may need to be configured
separately.  The real-time clock MCP79410 is driven by the ds1307
module, which should recognise the hardware given a sufficiently new
kernel version.
