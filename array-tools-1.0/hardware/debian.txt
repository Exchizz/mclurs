/etc/mclurs directory with config etc. including global environment
directory.



/var/run/mclurs directory with current hardware configuration, found
by mclurs-probe, including in a key-value format:

   serial number of box
   version number of hardware
   I2C bus number to use
   processor architecture

init.d script that runs mclurs-probe to generate the /var/run/mclurs
data.

mclurs-probe should:

   0: verify needed modules -- USBDUXfast driver and Comedi
   1: create the /var/run/ directory if needed
      (re-)initialise directory contents
   2: determine whether Analog Board and/or USBDUXfast is present:
         load I2C modules
	 probe I2C bus, look for 1-wire driver and EEPROM
	 probe for USBDUXfast
   3: probe for machine architecture (arm or intel)

   On ARM:
   4: get serial number of RPi
   5: get version type of RPi
   6: get serial number of Analog Board
   7: determine Analog Board version
   8: install modules and assign drivers for Analog Board hardware components

   On Intel:
   9: verify accessibility of an RPi with Analog Board

   If USBDUXfast:
   A: determine 'type' of USBDUXfast
