Known Bugs

The sequence init - go - halt - param - init -
go can succeed but after delivering 32MiB of
data the call to check how much data is in the
Comedi streaming buffer hangs...

Interestingly, having initialised the Comedi
subsystem, a comedi_close on the open device
is not sufficient to release the modules while
snapshot is still running.  Reloading the
modules would probably work to fix the bug
above, but is not possible without stopping
snapshot.

WRITER only allocates one file for a snapshot,
should do at least two.  Need to sort out how the
allocation of locked transfer RAM is to be
managed...
