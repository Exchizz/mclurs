Known Bugs

Non-default parameter initialisation for window
and bufhwm is broken: this means that when issuing
a P command they are not recomputed properly.

FIX: by adding a flag to the param module to note
when a parameter has been set explicitly by CMD,
ARG or ENV.

WRITER only allocates one file for a snapshot,
should do at least two.  Need to sort out how the
allocation of locked transfer RAM is to be
managed...
