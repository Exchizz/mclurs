Design of the new snapshotter program

The snapshotter is designed as far as possible to avoid starvation in
the reader loop and to do as few data copies as possible.  The design
comprises four threads as follows:

1. MAIN thread, where the program starts running.  This thread handles
   the processing of parameters from defaults, environment variables
   and arguments, checks and manipulates the capability sets and drops
   user privileges, calls the parameter verify routines and then runs
   the main messaging loop.

   The main messaging loop receives commands via the public socket and
   forwards them to the appropriate handler thread, collecting replies
   and passing them back to the external correspondent.

2. READER thread, responsible for interaction with Comedi and for data
   capture.  It initialises the Comedi ring buffer and memory maps it.
   It maintains a queue of work ordered by last sample index of data
   chunks to be written which have been passed from the WRITER thread.
   Its main loop processes command messages that set parameters and
   bring up or tear down the data capture channel, as well as dealing
   with the asynchronous flow of data.

   Data flow is managed by asking Comedi once per loop how many bytes
   are present in the ring buffer.  From this, the current head -- the
   latest sample available -- is computed.  If the head falls after
   the end of the first chunk on the work queue, that chunk can be
   processed: for the READER, this means copying a block of data from
   the mapped ring buffer to a pre-faulted memory-mapped are of file
   represented by the chunk.  There are no grounds for page faults
   during this copy because of the pre-faulting.

   If the head sample index falls after the current high-water mark,
   the ring buffer is sufficiently full.  A new position for the tail,
   the first (earliest) valid sample in the ring buffer is computed by
   subracting the desired window size from the current head.  The tail
   is moved to this point by instructing Comedi to discard earlier
   samples than this.

3. WRITER thread, which processes snapshot commands and is responsible
   for interaction with the file system.  When a snap command is
   issued, the writer creates the necessary files in sequence as
   required.  Each file is split into chunks, which are entered into
   the writer's work queue ordered by first sample index.

   Each cycle of its main loop processes command messages but also
   handles the work queue.  When there are resources available, the
   WRITER takes chunks from its queue and maps, locks and pre-faults
   the respective region of the file in memory, using a memory frame
   structure.  This means that the delays incurred by page faults
   while trying to find pages for the output files accrue to the
   WRITER, which tries to keep track of them and compensate for them
   in its main loop.  Chunks which have been mapped are passed to the
   READER for filling.

   Once the READER has filled a chunk (or determined that a chunk
   cannot be filled) the chunk is passed back to the WRITER which
   manages the snapshot status that follows from the chunk captures.

4. TIDY thread, which is passed the used locked memory frames from
   chunks that have been written or aborted.  In the latter case these
   frames are full of zeros, while in the former case they are full of
   valid data.  TIDY unmaps the frames, releasing the pages into the
   buffer cache from which they will be written out to long-term
   storage as dirty pages are flushed by the kernel.  Since delays
   might arise during unmapping, the TIDY thread exists to segregate
   such events from the READER.

   The TIDY thread runs unprivileged. It is responsible for generating
   the ZeroMQ message-passing context (which implies ZMQ I/O threads)
   so that the message-passing system runs unprivileged as well.

Submodules of snapshot.

adc:
	The interface to the ADC hardware.  This module encapsulates the
	Comedi interface code.

argtab-int16:
argtab-int64:

	Supplementary modules for libargtable2 that implement argument
	types for 16 and 64 bit integer values.

chunk:

	Files are split into chunks for the purpose of data transfer.
	Routines in this module allocate and release chunks and
	memory-mapped file data transfer frames, and handle data
	copying.

lut:

	Provides look-up tables and conversion functions to transform
	the raw data from the ADC hardware into standard format (16
	bit signed fixed point format with +/-1V peak amplitude).

mman:

	Encapsulates the calls require to memory map files, lock the
	resulting mapped pages and pre-fault them for reading and/or
	writing.

param:

	Everything to do with parameters, specifically parsing
	strings, value conversion, interface with environment
	variables and argument structures in libargtable2 format.

queue:

	Simple doubly-linked queue module.  Provides insertion and
	removal.  Associated header file provides list for macros.

rtprio:

	Looks after real-time scheduling and capability manipulation.

strbuf:

	Code to manage string buffers.  The buffers maintain a size
	pointer and have routines for printing into the buffer space.
	Extra (no argument) % conversions can be registered with the
	module to simplify e.g. error reporting -- the ADC module
	registers %C for Comedi errors, for example.

util:
	A few routines that simplify using the ZeroMQ message-passing
	library.  These handle socket opening and address binding,
	message assembly and object pointer transmission.

reader:

	Code that runs in the READER thread.  Comprises parameter
	handling, command processing, message handling, work queue
	implementation and main message loop.

snapshot:

	Code that runs in the MAIN thread: initialisation, parameter
	processing, user and capability management, thread creation,
	command reception and forwarding, and tidying up on exit are
	all handled in this module.

tidy:

	Code that runs in the TIDY thread.  Comprises frame-unmap in a
	simple message loop.  Release of transfer frames occurs in
	this thread.

writer:

	Code that runs in the WRITER thread.  Comprises parameter
	verification, command processing, status reporting, file
	system interface.  The mdoule defines snapshot and
	snapshot-file description structures and code to manipulate
	them, and handles chunking policy and allocation of transfer
	frames.  Deals with the file-system aspects of data capture
	errors reported by the READER.
	
Helper Utilities:

grab:

	Data capture program that uses the lut, mman and param module
	code.  It reads data from the memory-mapped and locked Coemdi
	ring buffer and dumps it to stdout as fast as it can.
	Argument handling is done by the standard mechanisms used in
	snapshot.

snapchat:

	Utility for talking to snapshot.  This program can send
	command messages to the snapshot program and present its
	replies.  It can execute multiple commands in sequence with
	acknowledgement checking.

trig:

	Program to generate snapshot requests on demand with
	configurable pre- and post-trigger windows and optional
	auto-generation of snapshot names.  Works by sending suitable
	commands to snapshot.
