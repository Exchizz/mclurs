Known bugs, things to do:  random order.

1. Fix error reporting on success of a snapshot: currently no-one
   writes the OK message to the error strbuf.

   **DONE**

2. Improve status return; fix removal of completed snapshots from the
   snapshot queue (currently doesn't work).

   **DONE**

3. Better logging/debug information everywhere.

4. Change READER numerical parameter bounds to #defines

   **DONE**

5. Add in code for data exhaustion in the READER: notice when data
   stops coming and do something about it (halt the ADC and go to ERROR
   state).

   **DONE**

6. Fix group handling so that the program takes all supplementary
   groups of a chosen user as well as the primary group; allow
   multiple --group arguments and take all listed groups when dropping
   privileges.

   [use initgroups() when only a user is given -- **DONE**;
    use setgroups() when a set of groups/GIDs are given instead]

7. Add in energy computaitons into the READER thread data acquisition
   loop, so that average energy over the last interval is always
   available.

   [some code added to lut.c as start of this feature]

8. Implement a PUBLISH socket through which the READER can
   periodically publish energy and sample number data; implement the
   publishing code.

9. Update all the manual pages to reflect the final set of command
   lines and options for the four utilities.

10. Add code to ensure that the locked memory resource limit is
   sufficient for our needs.

   [Need to retain/use CAP_SYS_RESOURCE to alter the limit]
