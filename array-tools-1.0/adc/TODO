Known bugs, things to do:  random order.

1. Better logging/debug information everywhere.  Separate normal
   logging (via log socket) from debug functionality (to stderr
   directly).

   [Added large strbufs for thread logging; added generic macros for
    FATAL_ERROR, WARNING and LOG that work in the different threads.

    Still need to make reporting levels consistent and fix some
    debugging dumps.
   ]

2. Add in energy computations into the READER thread data acquisition
   loop, so that average energy over the last interval is always
   available.

   [some code added to lut.c as start of this feature]

3. Implement a PUBLISH socket through which the READER can
   periodically publish energy and sample number data; implement the
   publishing code.

4. Update all the manual pages to reflect the final set of command
   lines and options for the four utilities.

   snapshot -- **DONE**

5. Remove requirement for the three capabilities in the situation
   where the user limits are sufficiently relaxed to allow snapshot to
   operate correctly without them.

   CAP_SYS_ADMIN is not needed if the Comedi buffer limit is already sufficient.
   CAP_IPC_LOCK  is not needed if the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK value is big enough.
   CAP_SYS_NICE  is not required if the RLIMIT_RTPRIO value is sufficient.

6. Improve snapshot status reporting for completed and in-progress
   snapshots.
